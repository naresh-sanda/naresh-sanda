### 🔍 About Me

With over **14 years of hands-on experience** in backend development, I’ve built and scaled distributed systems, high-traffic microservices, and cloud-native architectures for real-world business challenges.

I'm deeply rooted in **Java and Spring ecosystem**, but I thrive at the intersection of **backend systems, distributed computing, and AI-enabled automation**. Whether it’s designing fault-tolerant systems or experimenting with GPT-based developer tools, I enjoy solving hard problems with simplicity and scale in mind.
